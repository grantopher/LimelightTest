Book App

This is simple Titanium / Alloy project to get my feet wet in this developing environment.

On the main screen of the application is a list of the users favorite books. If the user taps on the listing the user is taken to a "book details" page with the book title and author.
The user may press the back button (Android only) to return to the main screen. On the top right of the main screen is the "Add Book" button. This takes the user to a form which allows them to enter in the title and author of their new favorite book. Once the book information has been typed in the user may press the Add button and is then taken back to the main screen where the new book listing is now shown. There is currently no way for the user to remove books. Also, all data temporary so any information added in the current session will be forgotten if the application is closed.
